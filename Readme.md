1. To run the programme move to the file ns-3-dev-git and use the following command
   ./waf --run scratch/fattree
   make sure you dont run fattree.cc it gives errors
2. After you run the code 2 files are created output-fattree.txt and raw-fattree.txt which has the necessary outputs
3. To change the code for three problem scenarios change the variables used in three for loops in the lines 92,110,147
4. run the code again with given parameters, make sure to delete or replace output files as the new files will generally append the values to old files if they exist already
